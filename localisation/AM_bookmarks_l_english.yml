 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "Gathering Storm"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Dark times are coming. In Europe, Adolf Hitler has consolidated his power and his attention is increasingly drawn beyond German borders. Benito Mussolini's Italy continues to embark on daring military adventures. Meanwhile in Asia, the Empire of Japan is poised to attack China. Not even a generation has passed since the end of the Great War and the world has apparently been doused in gasoline again. A single spark may be all it takes."
 HITTING_FAN_NAME:0 "The Hitting of the Fan"
 HITTING_FAN_DESC:0 "Yup, that's right! That umbrella collection is about to come in real handy."
 ENG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Although the United Kingdom emerged victorious from the Great War, the foundations of its great empire were shaken to the core. A generation of its finest young men were lost on the battlefields of Flanders and Northern France, while unrest spread throughout the Commonwealth and massive debts were accrued.\n\nWith the trauma of the last war still fresh in the memory, it is now facing up to the prospect of another war. It is becoming more apparent that there is unlikely to be 'Peace for Our Time'."
 FRA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Despite the devastation of the Great War, France is on the road to recovery thanks to its strong economy supported by German war reparations. However, the 'Great Depression' has still affected the country and the new German regime has shown little interest in continuing to pay the war reparations stipulated by the Treaty of Versailles.\n\nWith political unrest at home, the words of Marshal Ferdinand Foch when the treaty was signed "This is not a peace. It is an armistice for twenty years" appear to be an omen. Those 20 years are rapidly running out."
 GER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "A new proud Germany has arisen. Three years have passed since the Weimar Republic was dissolved and replaced by Adolf Hitler's 'Third Reich'. Economic stability has returned after the trying years of the 'Great Depression' and mass unemployment is a thing of the past.\n\nThe military restrictions imposed on Germany by the Versailles Treaty are long forgotten and the Wehrmacht grows stronger by the day. With rumours of German rearmament, could there be more conflict on the horizon?"
 ITA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "On the back of the rise of Fascism, Italy expects a new glorious era. Its forces are currently 'persuading' Ethiopia to be added to the growing Italian colonial empire, but do Benito Mussolini's ambitions stop there?\n\nDominion over the Mediterranean Basin has surely always been her destiny? With a new order of things seemingly taking shape in Europe, when the tidal wave of change arrives, Italy must find a place at its crest or run the risk of being swept away."
 JAP_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Empire of Japan stands at a crossroads. 'Hokushin-ron', the Northern Expansion Doctrine, is favoured by the Army and calls for an advance into Russia and China. 'Nanshin-ron', the Southern Expansion Doctrine, is supported by the Navy and has the resource rich European colonies in Southeast Asia and the Pacific as its target.\n\nJapan possesses a formidable military, but its industries are in urgent need of resources and time appears to be running out. Which path to choose?"
 SOV_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 ""A spectre is haunting Europe - The spectre of communism."\nWhen the dust had settled after the Civil War, the U.S.S.R. had emerged as the undisputed ruler over most of what had once constituted the Russian Empire. Rapid state industrialisation and collectivism followed, often at a great cost in human lives.\n\nNow the Soviet Union is faced with the threat of a resurgent Germany to the west and a belligerent Japan to the east. There are also internal threats within the ranks of the Communist Party to contend with as well..."
 USA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The United States retreated back into isolationism at the end of the Great War and enjoyed a period of economic prosperity during the Roaring Twenties. This came to a dramatic end when the nation was gripped by the 'Great Depression' in 1929.\n\nThe American policy of non-intervention in foreign wars has stood firm, but tension is increasing both in Europe and Asia. The 'Great Neutral' may find itself drawn into the maelstorm whether or not it wants to be."
 OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, both great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Great War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance their ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
 POL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:1 "Following centuries in which the nation was divided between three empires, Poland now stands proudly independent once again. However its political position is not an easy one.\n\nTo the east, the Soviet Union has not forgotten its humiliating defeat in the Polish-Soviet war.\n\nTo the west, the German Führer Adolf Hitler makes no secret of his desire for more "living space" for his people and that the former German land now under Polish control will be the first step in him achieveing it."
 CAN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Canada entered the Great War as a British colony and left it as a nation. Born in the sacrifices of the Passchendaele mud, Canada now takes its first few uncertain steps onto the world stage.\n\nHobbled by the 'Great Depression' and with internal divisions between Anglophones and Francophones, the future of this relatively new nation looks anything but secure."
 AST_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Australians earned their place in the history books of the Great War with their blood. The sacrifices made in the Gallipoli campaign have not been forgotten - and neither were those who ordered it.\n\nAustralia now stands at a crossroads: should she stay with her colonial master, most likely about to be drawn into more conflict in distant Europe, or should its focus be on the threat that is looming much closer to home?"
 SAF_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "When the Great War began, many in South Africa refused to take up arms for their British masters. The military spent most of the war chasing German forces around their African colonies with limited success.\n\nNow a new war looms on the horizon. Then as now, there are some in that think South Africa shouldn't be fighting against the Germans at all. Some even believe that the time has come for the descendants of the Boers to make their bid for the liberty that was denied to their forefathers."
 NZL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The tiny nation in the South Pacific fought bravely in the Great War, suffering high casualtie rates in the bloody battles at Gallipoli and on the Western Front. Nearly half the men of fighting age had served in the forces fighting overseas and many had not returned.\n\nSome twenty years after end of the Great War, the populace of New Zealand peer anxiously at world events, for this time the threat of war looms ever closer to their own homeland..."
 RAJ_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The 'crown jewel' of the British Empire, the Raj of India is a strange mix of imperial power and powerlessness. A small band of elite British civil servant's rule over a vast sub-continent with a populace of hundreds of millions of subjects. From these ranks they recruit the Indian Army, which fought bravely in the Great War.\n\nIndias leaders hoped that the sacrifices she made in the last war would help her gain independence from Britain, but so far, that hope has been dampened. With a new war looming, many Indians believe that the time has come to take freedom - by whatever means are necessary."
 CZE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "During the Great War, Czech troops fought alongside the Entente forces all over Europe in an effort to secure recognition for their nation. Their efforts were successful, and Czechoslovakia rose from the ashes of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.\n\nSince their explosive entry into statehood Czechoslovakia formed the 'Little Entente' alliance with Yugoslavia and Romania with the aim of suppressing Hungary's efforts to restore the Austro-Hungarian Empire, although as resurgent German power grows the political landscape of Europe is rapidly changing."
 HUN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "One half of the late Austro-Hungarian Empire, Hungary was treated as a defeated enemy by the victorious Entente after the Great War losing two thirds of its territory in the Treaty of Trianon. Millions of ethnic Hungarians found themselves living outside its borders, and its economy was left in ruins. Harsh restrictions on rearmament were supposed to ensure that Hungary could never again threaten the peace in Europe.\n\nAs the political climate in Europe shifts, it may be time to finally right the wrongs of the past and regain the former glory of the nation."
 ROM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Romania found herself on the winning side in the Great War, and as a result, gained new territories and people - not all of whom were Romanians. To guard against the desires of those countries that were forced to cede land to regain what they felt was rightfully theirs, Romania has created a web of alliances across the Balkans. However, in recent years she has mostly concerned herself with domestic matters and the government of King Carol II has allowed these alliances to lapse.\n\nAs the political situation in Europe changes, Romania may well find herself standing alone - and vulnerable."
 YUG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Yugoslavia came into existence after the merging of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes with the formerly independent Kingdom of Serbia in 1922. Initially Yugoslavia joined both the Little Entente and the Balkan Pact to secure their independence, but recently the assassination of King Alexander, combined with growing pressure internally from nationalists and externally from Italy and Germany has caused drastic upheaval and allowed for a re-evaluation of their political and strategic position."
 MAN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Evicted from the Dragon Throne at the age of six, Puyi, the last Chinese Emperor, has been biding his time. While his former realm tore itself apart in the Chinese Civil War, Puyi found new allies in Japan.\n\nFor Puyi, the establishment of the Empire of Manchukuo in 1932 was but the first step in the quest to reclaim his ancestral birthright. For the moment, he is dependent on the Japanese Army to keep his rule, but in time, an opportunity might arise to cast off the shackles of servitude and become what he was born to be..."
 CHI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Following the revolution that deposed the last of the Qing Emperors, the young Chinese Republic has struggled to survive. Warlords rule much of the land on the periphery. In the heart of the country, the Communists have set up a base area in a remote mountain valley. Just beyond the borders, the Japanese have created a puppet government under the last Chinese Emperor and will try to reunite the country under his rule.\n\nWith many enemies threatening it, the government of Chiang Kai-Shek will have to make hard choices if it wants to survive and rule supreme in China."
 PRC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "A mere two years ago, the Communist Party of China faced utter annihilation. To survive, it engaged on the epic journey that would become known as the Long March. With only a fraction of the army surviving the rigors of the march and little industry, the prospects of victory in the Chinese Civil War are slim indeed.\n\nBut in time, the population may be swayed to the Communist cause, new armies be raised, new base areas established, and, when the time is right, the revolutionary struggle will be renewed again, until final victory is achieved."
 WARLORDS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The weakness of the Central Government may yet provide the opportunity for a sufficiently ambitious man to rise to power. At the periphery of the country, local leaders have carved out their own little fiefdoms, caring little for the orders of the Central Government.\n\nWar is on the horizon, and each of these Warlords faces a difficult choice: Collaboration with the Central Government or an alliance with the Communists? Either option promises a chance for a seat at the table, but there is a third possibility - to take China all for themselves."

 TUR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The youthful Republic of Turkey has finally shaken off its historic Ottoman past. Under the leadership of Mustafa Kemal the old ways are being consigned to history and a newer, more modern Turkey is slowly emerging.\n\nDoes Turkeys geographical position mean that it is well placed to capitalise if war once again breaks out in Europe? Will she be able to defend herself, if attacked, by any of the major factions?"
 FIN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Finnish Republic looks nervously to the East. Despite a healthy recovery from the 'Great Depression' diplomatic relations with the Russian bear are starting to become strained. Rumours abound that the blood of Finnish civillians is being spilt in the former Finnish Karelian region.\n\nOur tiny nation is no match for the mighty Soviets should conflict come. Perhaps though, we can still give them a bloody nose and maybe find willing allies to help support our cause?"
 SWE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Sweden is steadily growing its indutrial base to meet demand for its steel, ball bearings and wood products. Can this fruitful Social Democratic nation ride out a potential European conflict?\n\nWould such a conflict perhaps give it an opportunity, along with its Scandanavian neighbours, to align and unite to face its common enemies? "
 HOL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Holland is still feeling the crippling effects of the 'Great Depression'. With growing unrest within its civillian population will the country be forced to ditch the 'gold standard' which many blame for its current woes?\n\nMeanwhile the Dutch government is heavily relying on its stated neutrality to avoid getting embroilled in European conflict, should it come."
 BEL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Belgium may be seen by some as an insignificant territory but its posiition as a densly industrialiseed country extracting preciosu resources from its African colony make it a potential target for those with lofty ambitions....\n\nRecovering from the 'Great Depression' with major infrastructure projects underway it still seems that a greater number of voters seek solutions in extremist discourses. Leon Degrelle is gaining popularity and may come to threaten the traditional coalitions of the democratic parties. Flemish nationalists are also active, spreading trouble amongst Flemish soldiers!"
 IRE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Irish Free State has managed to remain a democracy despite the growth of dictatorships within mainland Europe and the 'Great Depression'.\n\nWith a new world conflict potentially on the horizon should the nation align itself with enemies of the hated United Kingdom or should it attempt to remain neutral and try to secure independence and a united Ireland through diplomatic means?"
 SPR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Born in 1931, the Second Spanish Republic is desestablized. The fall of the centrist government of Alejandro Lerroux due to corruption scandals has led to new elections in february. In the meanwhile, the government of Manuel Portela rules the country.\n\nPowered by leftist republicans and the PCE, the left-wing elements, except the anarchist CNT, have united in the Popular Front. In the meanwhile, the right is divided in monarchists, fascists and the legalist CEDA. In the edge of a civil war, consumed by violence and in need of modernization, how will Spain survive?"
 POR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Portugese Second Republic, led by António de Oliveira Salazar is a mildly fascist coporative state led by a single party regime.\n\nWith its only neighbour seemingly heading for civil war, how will this country react should another war break out on its borders? "
 IRQ_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Born out of three former Ottoman Vilayets, Iraq first came into existence under British administration in 1920 with King Faisal and was granted independence in 1932, but with continued British presence. After Faisal's death in 1933, the country became a pressure cooker, at any moment it would blow up in a civil war. On one side the nationalists and on the other the pro-UK militants.\n\nWill you be able to restore the stability of your country? Or will you bring it to ruin?"
 BUL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Bulgaria found itself on the losing side of the Great War. Whatever was left of the third Bulgarian Empire was destroyed by the Allied Powers and their forced demilitarization of Bulgaria. On top of demands of the Western Powers, Bulgaria's fellow Balkan countries also placed reistrictions upon the country.  \n\nUnlike Austria, Germany and Hungary however, Bulgaria had a clean record of abiding by the peace demands of the Allied Powers."
 
 KOREAN_WAR_NAME:0 "Korean War"
 KOREAN_WAR_DESC:0 "The Korean War was a war between North Korea (with the support of China and the Soviet Union) and South Korea (with the support of the United Nations, with the principal support from the United States). The war began on 25 June 1950 when North Korea invaded South Korea following a series of clashes along the border."
 ENG_KOREAN_WAR_DESC:0 "The era of British Imperialism has come to an end. The allure of independence is far too great for those subjugated under the British crown. Her colonies around the world are seeing increases in popularity for Nationalist and Communist movements alike. As the United Kingdom's global power wanes, it looks to its Western allies to safeguard against the threat of Communism, now closer than ever. Long gone are the fears of Oswald Mosley, now the fear of Communism grips the hearts of the British Commonwealth."
 KOR_KOREAN_WAR_DESC:0 "Finally free of both US and Japanese occupation, the newly established Republic of Korea was hopeful for peaceful reunification with their separated countrymen above the 38th parallel. But after the suspicious assassination of the only senior politician willing to negotiate with the North and the staunch anti-Communist Lee Seung Man winning the presidency, that hope was waning fast. The US may have handed over the keys but neither Korea is in control, and with both republics claiming the peninsula conflict is inevitable."
 WGR_KOREAN_WAR_DESC:0 "The once great German nation has been defeated once more. With the glory of the German empire just a distant memory, and the euphoria of their conquests just years earlier marred by shame and frustration, the German people once again find themselves at the barrel of a gun. Occupied by both superpowers of the world, they are the chess board for their political games. Tired are the people of Germany, with a great deal of rebuilding to do. All that's left is hope for de escalation and reunification with their Eastern brethren."
 GER_KOREAN_WAR_DESC:0 "The once great German nation has been defeated once more. With the glory of the German empire just a distant memory, and the euphoria of their conquests just years earlier marred by shame and frustration, the German people once again find themselves at the barrel of a gun.

All that's left is hope for de escalation and reunification with their Eastern brethren."
 DDR_KOREAN_WAR_DESC:0 "Under Soviet Military governorship, the people of East Germany find themselves under the rule of the very people they oppressed. Morale is low, but things are looking up as plans are in place to create a German Democratic Republic. With Soviet leaderships, construction is making good progress, but life is difficult as the society has become strictly regimented and the full blame of the war is laid upon their shoulders. Already, large portions of the population have adopted the Communist ideology wholeheartedly, creating an ideological divide between the two Germany’s that may last for generations…"
 DPR_KOREAN_WAR_DESC:0 "Shortly following the declaration of the Republic of Korea, revolutionary Kim Il Sung along with the Soviet Civil Administration have drafted the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. Now independent of Soviet control and with borders with two powerful Communist nations Kim is poised to liberate his comrades below the 38th parallel. With Soviet equipment, Chinese manpower and a unified population under the Juche system, the War for Korean Reunification should be a cakewalk. After all, their guardian, the United States, is busy with bigger problems…"
 PRC_KOREAN_WAR_DESC:0 "The Japanese have been defeated and the ceasefire with the Kuomintang has broken. The People’s Liberation Army has grown exponentially and with the equipment left behind by the Japanese, the People’s Republic is prepared the secure the rest of China. Despite minimal assistance from the Soviet Union, the leadership of Mao Ze Dong following the Great March has allowed Chinese Communism to flourish. Just a few more key cities, and China shall finally be united!"
 SOV_KOREAN_WAR_DESC:0 "Thanks to the sacrifice of millions of brave Communists, Fascism has for the most part been wiped off of the Earth. But behind the fallen monster hides an even greater threat. The threat of Capitalism. Only having just liberated themselves, the Soviet Union must stand up to protect the world from yet another imperialistic system. The people of the world require a strong guiding hand, and there is no better candidate than the Soviet Union. Communism is gaining momentum, and Joseph Stalin intends to keep it that way."
 USA_KOREAN_WAR_DESC:0 "With the United States victory in the Second World War, it has positioned itself as the champion of Western Democracy. Strongly upholding its Capitalist values, it vehemently opposes the Communist East, led by the Soviet Union. Instead of demilitarizing after the destruction caused by WW2, the nation's military continues to grow to face the red menace. But now that nukes are on the table for both sides, could the United States and the West truly survive against such a formidable foe?"
 ISR_KOREAN_WAR_DESC:0 "Zionism has finally been realized and a Jewish state has been established. Although the first few years were marred by the Arab-Israeli War, the Israelites with the help of their Western allies have not only fought off the Arabs but seized additional land. The Holy Land is splintered and surrounded by hostile forces but the Jewish resolve, hardened by the holocaust, is resilient. Not since before the Romans had there been an independent Jewish state, and the Jews do not intend to let this opportunity slip through their fingers."
 YUG_KOREAN_WAR_DESC:0 "Following the Yugoslav-Soviet split in 1948, Tito’s model of Market Socialism was working well with funding from the United State’ Marshall Plan. Yugoslavia, while being greatly damaged by Italian and German occupation found themselves with a better quality of living than any other Communist state. However, their political stability was something else entirely. Tito was beloved by his countrymen, but his strategy of neutrality was despised by both East and West. With constant threats from both sides, can Yugoslavia maintain itself as an independent Socialist country?"
 IRQ_KOREAN_WAR_DESC:0 "After the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, Iraq stands in a position to do much in the Middle East despite its loss in that war, yet it faces a problem with Kurd rebels, most recently inspired by Mustafa Barzani's revolt. Iraq depends upon the British which have access to their oil through the Iraqi Petroleum Company in exchange for aid. At this Hashemite court, there is great conflict between the new "free" military officers and the old monarchist court that must be resolved."
 EGY_KOREAN_WAR_DESC:0 "The Sultanate of Egypt is said to have achieved independence in 1922 however a large portion of the population do not believe this to be true in anything more than name. King Farouk is seen by many Egyptians as a key instrument to British control over the Suez Canal. There is opposition to the reigning monarch in all circles; government, civilian and military. It is the will of Egyptian and Pan-Arab nationalists to liberate the Suez from British hands. The continued rule of King Farouk looks unlikely without extraordinary British support."
 JAP_KOREAN_WAR_DESC:0 "Japans imperial ambitions were crushed by the allies. Now under American occupation, this former imperal power is now trying to recover from the devestating firebombing campaign it faced during World war 2. How will Japanese future look? Will they be embrace the new democratic path or do something more radical?"
 OTHER_KOREAN_WAR_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Second World War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
 
 SOVIET_COLLAPSE_NAME:0 "Fall of the Soviet Union"
 SOVIET_COLLAPSE_DESC:0 "On December 26, the Council of the Republics, the upper chamber of the Union's Supreme Soviet, voted both itself and the Soviet Union out of existence. (The lower chamber, the Council of the Union, had been unable to work since December 12, when the recall of the Russian deputies left it without a quorum.) The following day Yeltsin moved into Gorbachev's former office, though the Russian authorities had taken over the suite two days earlier. By the end of 1991, the few remaining Soviet institutions that had not been taken over by Russia ceased operation, and individual republics assumed the central government's role."

 MODERN_DAY_NAME:0 "Modern Day"
 MODERN_DAY_DESC:0 "With China claiming territorial waters around its coastlines, with Russia marching into Crimea, with the terrorist Islamic State proclaiming its caliphate, will the world stay the same? The United Kingdom has voted to Leave the European Union. Recent terrorist attacks have the entirety of the French national principles shaken. Refugees are seeking shelter from wars and unrest in Syria and Libya. The last presidential election in the USA has rocked the world as we know it and yet, The world is still changing."
 ENG_MODERN_DAY_DESC:0 "After Britian has voted to leave the European Union on June 23rd and David Cameron left office, New Prime Minister Theresa May has a challange ahead of her. Will May keep Britian in the Single Market or will the presure of Leave supporters be too much? With tensions rising, Remain supporters fighting and the devloved administrations against her can the New Prime Minister unite a divided country or will it all fall apart?"
 FRA_MODERN_DAY_DESC:0 "France has suffered from economic hardship and from major terrorist attacks in Paris. The French people grow increasingly antagonistic to their muslim and jewish minorities. The Front National is looking at a possibility to perhaps take power in these troubled times. Will the democratic establishment and French European integration prevail? Or will France stand on her own like in the good old days?"
 GER_MODERN_DAY_DESC:0 "Germany, hit by refugee crisis, economic hardship and growing internal resentment to countries like Greece, Italy and Spain, is still going strong. The European Union ever expands southwards. The European neighbors grow increasingly annoyed at Germany's policies. Is it worth it to continue that path? Or is it perhaps the time to revive border conflicts of old and let the soldiers march again?"

 JAP_MODERN_DAY_DESC:0 "Japan is faced with the possibility of war each passing day, as Chinese naval vessels aggressively close into the Senkaku Islands and as North Korean missiles are launched into the stratosphere. Article 9 of the Japanese constitution has recently been amended to allow for a more active Japanese military abroad. This militaristic stance is unpopular with the people, but perhaps necessary to maintain the national security."
 ITA_MODERN_DAY_DESC:0 "No country of the G7 and the great four of Europe has been so strongly affected by the economic crisis of 2008 like Italy has. Recovery is slow and government support dwindling. The influx of African migrants is not helping at giving the people the image of internal stability. Italy needs to consider her choices. Surely this is not the time to revive imperialism, but drastic reforms will be necessary..."
 PRC_MODERN_DAY_DESC:0 "China is very focussed on not letting her enemies not her weaknesses. Pollution, internal migration problems, a dwindling standard in the military, the ever corrupt governing body of the Communist Party. And yet, China is the giant of the east, the one that all the small countries fear. Japan, South Korea, the rebels in Taiwan, Vietnam... all of them united in their hatred for China. It is time for China to find a meaningful answer."

 SPR_MODERN_DAY_DESC:0 "Like other Southern European countries, Spain has fallen into economic crisis in 2008, requiring economic stimuli from Northern European economies. Podemos and Ciudadanos have brought a new populism and new uncertainty to the old political system, while Catalonian independence movements are more threatening to Spanish unity than ever.\n\nEconomic Recovery will be a long and rocky path - will Spain stay with Europe and stick to the agreements that prevent immediate disaster - or is the future of Spain a different one from the future of Northern Europe?"
 SOV_MODERN_DAY_DESC:0 "Kicked out of the G8, faced with massive economic sanctions, struggling with maintaining its sphere of influence, but at least reunited with its brethren on Crimea.

With the west now greatly antagonistic to Russia, it must consider either apologizing and retreating into its internationally acknowledged territory or it must find new allies. Beijing comes to mind."
